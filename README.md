In 1989 Kid Pix 1.0 was released into the public domain and this is an HTML/JS reimplementation.

### Guide
Just like the original Kid Pix, there's no guide‚Äîhave fun!  Most of the tools support Shift (^) to enlarge. There are a handful of hidden tool features behind various modifier keys (‚åò, ‚å•, ‚áß). The modifier keys can also be combined. Enjoy! :)

### Development & Deployment

This project uses a build script to concatenate and format all JavaScript files:

```bash
./build.sh  # Formats code and builds js/app.js
```

Deployment to GitHub Pages is automated via GitHub Actions. Every push to the `main` branch triggers the build script and deploys the site automatically.

### Recent Enhancements

This fork includes several enhancements for the **Claude Draws** project, where Claude for Chrome creates original artworks:

- **Status Bar**: Displays current tool, active modifiers (SHIFT/OPTION/CTRL), and a 5-minute countdown timer
- **Modifier Toggle Buttons**: On-screen buttons to programmatically control SHIFT, OPTION, and CTRL modifiers
- **Improved Accessibility**: Disabled image dragging and toolbar scrolling for better touch/click control
- **Canvas Size**: Adjusted to 800x600 for the Claude Draws project
